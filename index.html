                <p>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Bengali: শেখ মুজিবুর রহমান; 17 March 1920 – 15 August 1975), shortened as
                    Sheikh
                </p>
                <p>Mujib or Mujib, was a Bangladeshi politician and statesman. He is called the "Father of the Nation"
                    in
                </p>
                <p>Bangladesh. He served as the first President of Bangladesh and later as the Prime Minister of
                    Bangladesh
                </p>
                <p>from 17 April 1971 until his assassination on 15 August 1975.[1] He is considered to be the driving
                    force
                </p>
                <p>behind the independence of Bangladesh. He is popularly dubbed with the title of "Bangabandhu"
                    (Bôngobondhu</p>
                <p>"Friend of Bengal") by the people of Bangladesh. He became a leading figure in and eventually the
                    leader
                    of</p>
                <p>the Awami League, founded in 1949 as an East Pakistan–based political party in Pakistan. Mujib is
                    credited</p>
                <p>as an important figure in efforts to gain political autonomy for East Pakistan and later as the
                    central
                </p>
                <p>figure behind the Bangladesh Liberation Movement and the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Thus, he
                    is
                </p>
                <p>regarded as "Jatir Janak" or "Jatir Pita" (Jatir Jônok or Jatir Pita, both meaning "Father of the
                    Nation")</p>
                <p>of Bangladesh. His daughter Sheikh Hasina is the current leader of the Awami League and also the
                    Prime
                </p>
                <p>Minister of Bangladesh.

                <p>An initial advocate of democracy and socialism, Mujib rose to the ranks of the Awami League and East
                </p>
                <p>Pakistani politics as a charismatic and forceful orator. He became popular for his opposition to the
                    ethnic</p>
                <p>and institutional discrimination of Bengalis in Pakistan, who comprised the majority of the state's
                </p>
                <p>population. At the heightening of sectional tensions, he outlined a six-point autonomy plan and was
                    jailed</p>
                <p>by the regime of Field Marshal Ayub Khan for treason. Mujib led the Awami League to win the first
                    democratic</p>
                <p>election of Pakistan in 1970. Despite gaining a majority, the League was not invited by the ruling
                    military</p>
                <p>junta to form a government. As civil disobedience erupted across East Pakistan, Mujib indirectly
                    announced</p>
                <p>independence of Bangladesh during a landmark speech on 7 March 1971. On 26 March 1971, the Pakistan
                    Army
                </p>
                <p>responded to the mass protests with Operation Searchlight, in which Prime Minister–elect Mujib was
                    arrested</p>
                <p>and flown to solitary confinement in West Pakistan, while Bengali civilians, students, intellectuals,
                </p>
                <p>politicians and military defectors were murdered as part of the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. During
                    Mujib's
                </p>
                <p>absence, many Bengalis joined the Mukti Bahini and, helped by the Indian Armed Forces, defeated the
                    Pakistan</p>
                <p>Armed Forces during the Bangladesh Liberation War. After Bangladesh's independence, Mujib was
                    released
                    from</p>
                <p>Pakistani custody due to international pressure and returned to Dhaka in January 1972 after a short
                    visit
                    to</p>
                <p>Britain and India.

                <p>Mujib became the Prime Minister of Bangladesh under a parliamentary system adopted by the new
                    country. He
                </p>
                <p>charged the provisional parliament to write a new constitution proclaiming the four fundamental
                    principles</p>
                <p>of "nationalism, secularism, democracy, and socialism", which reflect his political views
                    collectively
                    known</p>
                <p>as Mujibism. The Awami League won a huge mandate in the country's first general election in 1973.
                    However,</p>
                <p>Mujib faced challenges of rampant unemployment, poverty and corruption, as well as the Bangladesh
                    famine
                    of</p>
                <p>1974. The government was criticized for denying constitutional recognition to indigenous minorities
                    and
                </p>
                <p>human rights violations by its security forces, notably the National Defence Force or Jatiya Rakkhi
                    Bahini</p>
                <p>paramilitary. Amid rising political agitation, Mujib initiated one party socialist rule in January
                    1975.
                    Six</p>
                <p>months later, he and most of his family were assassinated by renegade army officers during a coup. A
                    martial</p>
                <p>law government was subsequently established
